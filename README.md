# Kite Python Plugin for Vim/Neovim

Kite is an AI-powered programming assistant that helps you write Python code inside Atom. The
[Kite Engine](https://kite.com/) needs to be installed in order for the package to work properly. The package itself
provides the frontend that interfaces with the Kite Engine, which runs 100% locally on your computer performing all the code analysis and machine learning (no code is sent to a cloud server).


### Features

Kite helps you write code faster by showing you the right information at the right time. Learn more about how Kite helps you while using Vim at https://kite.com/integrations/vim/.

At a high level, Kite provides you with:
* üß† __[Line-of-Code Completions](https://github.com/kiteco/vim-plugin/blob/vim-plugin-readme-updates/README.md#Line-of-Code_Completions)__ powered by machine learning models trained on the entire open source code universe
* üìù __[Intelligent Snippets](https://github.com/kiteco/vim-plugin/blob/vim-plugin-readme-updates/README.md#Intelligent_Snippets)__ that automatically provide context-relevant code snippets for your function calls
* üîç __[Instant documentation](https://github.com/kiteco/vim-plugin/blob/vim-plugin-readme-updates/README.md#Kite_Copilot)__ for the symbol underneath your cursor so you save time searching for Python docs


### Installation

Kite is easy to install and only takes a few minutes. Download Kite from https://kite.com/.  During Kite's installation process, select Vim and/or Neovim in the list of editors and Kite will install this plugin for you.

Kite will also keep the plugin up to date automatically.

Requires Vim 8 or NeoVim.

### Line-of-Code Completions

Kite's ranked completions are integrated with Vim's insert-mode completion, specifically the user-defined completion.  Kite shows normal completions or signature-completions as appropriate for the cursor position.

By default Kite's completions will show up automatically as you type.  You can opt out via:

```viml
let g:kite_auto_complete=0
```

You can manually invoke the completions in insert mode with `<C-X><C-U>`.  See `:h i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U` for details.

Kite's completions include snippets by default.  To opt out of the snippets, add this to your vimrc:

```viml
let g:kite_snippets=0
```

Normally you insert the currently selected completion option with `<C-y>`.  If you'd like to use `<Tab>` instead / as well, add this to your vimrc:

```viml
let g:kite_tab_complete=1
```

Every time you enter a Python buffer the plugin updates `completeopt` as follows:

```viml
set completeopt+=menuone   " show the popup menu even when there is only 1 match
set completeopt+=noinsert  " don't insert any text until user chooses a match
set completeopt-=longest   " don't insert the longest common text
```

To see documentation in the preview window for each completion option, copy all the lines above into your vimrc and change the preview line to:

```viml
set completeopt+=preview
```

To have the preview window automatically closed once a completion has been inserted:

```viml
autocmd CompleteDone * if !pumvisible() | pclose | endif
```

We also recommend:

```viml
set belloff+=ctrlg  " if vim beeps during completion
```


#### Intelligent Snippets

Some completions autogenerate code snippets which can be filled in.  These will be highlighted with the Underline highlight group.

You can navigate between placeholders with `<CTRL-J>` (forward) and `<CTRL-K>` (backward), even after you have typed over the original placeholder text.

To change these keys:

```viml
let g:kite_previous_placeholder = '<C-H>'
let g:kite_next_placeholder = '<C-L>`
```


### Signatures

Kite can show how other people used the signature you are using.  By default this is off to save space.

To turn it on: `:KiteShowPopularPatterns`.

To turn it off: `:KiteHidePopularPatterns`.


### Kite Copilot for Python Documentation

As you edit your code in Vim/Neovim, the [Kite Copilot](https://kite.com/copilot/) will automatically show examples and docs for the code under the cursor.

Alternatively, you can press `K` when the cursor is on a keyword to view its documentation in Kite Copilot.

If you have mapped `K` already, the plugin won't overwrite your mapping.

You can set an alternative mapping, e.g. to `gK`, like this:

```viml
nmap <silent> <buffer> gK <Plug>(kite-docs)
```

By default you need to type `K` (or whatever you have mapped to `<Plug>(kite-docs)`) each time you want to see documentation for the keyword under the cursor.  To have the documentation continually update itself as you move from keyword to keyword:

```viml
let g:kite_documentation_continual=1
```


### Commands

- `KiteDocsAtCursor` - show documentation for the keyword under the cursor.
- `KiteOpenCopilot` - open the Kite Copilot and focus on it.
- `KiteGeneralSettings` - open Kite's settings in the Copilot.
- `KitePermissions` - open Kite's permission settings in the Copilot.
- `KiteHelp` - show overview documentation.
- `KiteEnableAutoStart` - start Kite automatically when Vim starts.
- `KiteDisableAutoStart` - do not start Kite automatically when Vim starts.



### Statusline

Add `%{kite#statusline()}` to your statusline to get an indicator of what Kite is doing.  If you don't have a status line, this one matches the default when `&ruler` is set:

```viml
set statusline=%<%f\ %h%m%r%{kite#statusline()}%=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P
set laststatus=2  " always display the status line
```


### Debugging

Use `let g:kite_log=1` to switch on logging.  Logs are written to `kite-vim.log` in Vim's current working directory.
